Calculator Using TKinter
By Nafi Bin Mostafa.

The initial idea behind this project was to build something that will have a real world application.
After researching other projects on github, using Tkinter, the idea of a calculator came about.
Initially starting out I faced a multitude of problems, some of them include, user information not being entered correctly, evaluation of mathematical expressions returning error,switching  window for an investment calculator not working properly.
All of these problems were overcome by strategic planning and researching online resources.
Since this calculator is one of my biggest projects a lot of dedicated hours of the day need to be put into it.
Starting out I barely had mapped how the calculator  was going to look, as I went on building the project, ideas for making the calculator better would just come to me. 
The point to take from here is that when building projects it's best to just start and then do the planning along the way. Another huge problem I faced was my unfamiliarity with matplotlib.
I have heard a lot about it before but I did not have any experience with this library.
In conclusion It was a very amazing experience using TKinter and Matplotlib to create some fun visuals. I am excited to learn more about data and data manipulation during my post-secondary years.

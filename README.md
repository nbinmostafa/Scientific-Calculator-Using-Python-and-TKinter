ðŸ§® Calculator using Tkinter â€“ by Nafi Bin Mostafa

## Overview
This project began with a simple goal: to build something practical using Python. After browsing similar Tkinter-based projects on GitHub, I decided to create a calculatorâ€”not just a basic one, but one with real-world utility, including features like an investment calculator and visual representations using Matplotlib.

##Project Journey
- At the start, I had no clear roadmap. I dove in headfirst and encountered several challenges:

- User input handling: Managing valid mathematical expressions and preventing input errors.

- Expression evaluation: Making sure calculations worked as expected.

- Multi-window logic: Switching between the main calculator and the investment calculator was tricky.

- Learning Matplotlib: I had no prior experience with it, so visualizing data was a whole new challenge.

Every problem I faced pushed me to research, plan better, and explore new libraries. As I kept building, new ideas emerged organically. This taught me a key lesson: Start building firstâ€”refinement and creativity follow.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python

- Tkinter â€“ For the GUI

- Matplotlib â€“ For data visualization (used in the investment calculator)

## Key Takeaways
This was one of my most ambitious projects in high school. It taught me problem-solving, persistence, and how powerful simple tools like Tkinter and Matplotlib can be. Iâ€™m now even more excited to dive deeper into programming, especially in data and UI development, in my post-secondary journey.

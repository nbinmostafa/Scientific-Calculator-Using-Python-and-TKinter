Puting Entry for numbers in a function of its own
Done using one single function that creates buttons according to rows and columns
Evaluating the expression 
Converting ‘x’ and ‘÷’ to ‘*’ and “/”  and calling the eval method to calculate it
Adding logic to buttons 
Since all buttons were created using  a single function two different functions were created ‘evaluate_exp’ and “handle_buttons’ the handle button functions handles the input in such a way it does not raise an error when calculating the whole expression, the ‘evaluate_exp” calculates the final result


Lessons learned
The same program can be done in many different ways
The  program infrastructure varies from programmer to programmer.
Isolating each function and its functionality and then creating a function to handle them is better than putting everything in __init__ function.
THE EVAL() METHOD.
THE ISDIGIT() METHOD

1)The pi symbol was not being evaluated.
= math.pi() 
2)Factorials were returning errors.
= using the math module
3)Switching to a different window
